Queries for graphql:
---------------------
-User Story1:User Story 1: Querying Product Data
Given I have a list of product IDs,
When I create a GraphQL query to fetch product details,
Then I should receive only the product name, price, and category fields.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
query GetProductsByIds{
  products {
    name
    price
    category {
      categoryName
    }
  }
}

-User Story2:User Story 2: Mutating User Profile Information
Given I need to update a user's email and address,
When I write a GraphQL mutation for updating user profile information,
Then the system should update the user details and return the updated information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mutation UpdateUserProfile($userId: Int!, $email: String!, $address: String!) {
  updateUserProfile(userId: $userId, email: $email, address: $address) {
    userId
    userName
    email
    createdAt
    addresses {
      addressId
      addressLine1
    }
  }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "userId": 1,
  "email": "newemail@example.com",
  "address": "123 New Address"
}

-User Story5:User Story 5: Combining Multiple Data Sources
Given I want to see product reviews and ratings together,
When I use GraphQL to query data from both reviews and products,
Then I should receive a combined view of the product's feedback and ratings in a single response.
These user stories are straightforward and designed to guide your participants through basic GraphQL operations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
query GetProductReviewsAndRatings {
  products{
    name
    price
    reviews {
      reviewId
      rating
      comment
      reviewDate
    }
  }
}
